	<h1>Who is Usain Bolt ?</h1>
	<section>
	<p>Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt was dubbed "the fastest man alive" after winning three gold medals at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, China, and becoming the first man in Olympic history to win both the 100- and 200-meter races in record times.He made history again at the 2016 Summer Games in Rio with gold medals in the 100- and 200-meter races and 4x100-meter relay; the wins gave him a "triple-triple" — three golds over three consecutive Olympics — though he later was stripped of one of the relay golds because of a teammate's doping violation.</p>

<h2>Childhood and Early Successes. </h2>
	<p>Bolt was born on August 21, 1986, in Jamaica. Both a standout cricket player and a sprinter early on, Bolt's natural speed was noticed by coaches at school, and he began to focus solely on sprinting under the tutelage of Pablo McNeil, a former Olympic sprint athlete. (Glen Mills would later serve as Bolt's coach and mentor.) As early as age 14, Bolt was wowing fans with his lightning speed, and he won his first high school championship medal in 2001, taking the silver in the 200-meter race.</p>

<h2>Top Speed</h2>
	<p>At the Berlin 2009 World Championships, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nbjhpcZ9_g">Bolt set a world record time </a> of 9.58 seconds for the 100m race, notching a top speed of 27.8 miles per hour (44.72 kilometers per hour) between meters 60 and 80, with an average speed of 23.5 mph.</p>

<h2>Olympic Career</h2>
 <p>At the 2008 Beijing <a href="https://www.instagram.com/usainbolt/?hl=ru">Summer Olympics</a>, Bolt ran the 100-meter and 200-meter events. In the 100-meter final leading up to the Games, he broke the world record, winning in 9.69 seconds. Not only was the record set without a favorable wind, but he also visibly slowed down to celebrate before he finished (and his shoelace was untied), an act that aroused much controversy later on. He went on to win three gold medals and break three world records in Beijing.</p>

 <p>At the 2012 Summer Olympic Games, held in London, Bolt won his fourth Olympic gold medal in the men's 100-meter race, beating rival Yohan Blake, who won silver in the event. Bolt ran the race in 9.63 seconds, a new Olympic record. The win marked Bolt's second consecutive gold medal in the 100. He went on to compete in the men's 200, claiming his second consecutive gold medal in that race as well. He became the first man to win both the 100 and 200 in consecutive Olympic Games, as well as the first man to ever win back-to-back gold medals in double sprints. Bolt's accomplishments made him the first man in history to set three world records in a single Olympic Games competition.</p>

<h2>Disaster sprint</h2>
<p>Bolt's last Olympic appearance came at the 2016 Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro, where he won three gold medals. He then returned to the track in 2017, in what would be the final year of his career.
Bolt finished third in the 100-meter dash at the 2017 world championships and was the anchor leg on Jamaica's 4x100 relay team a few days later. He received the baton, took a few steps and winced in pain — stricken by another one of the<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRsy8i04Ylg"> hamstring injuries</a> that plagued him throughout his career. Bolt announced his retirement thereafter.</p>

<p>The great Jamaican sprinter was beaten by Justin Gatlin in the 100m final at the World Championships in London. Young British athlete Reece Prescod describes what it was like to race against two giants of the track</p>

<h3>How many medals did he win?</h3>
<img src="https://assets.catawiki.nl/assets/2018/9/14/0/1/f/01fb7cb5-2cf9-4afe-a22c-c9664c27f465.jpg" height="500" width="680">
<p>
Bolt won a total of eight Olympic medals in 2008, 2012 and 2016. He swept the 100 and 200 meters at all three Games, and helped Jamaica win the 4x100 relay in two of them. (Jamaica's relay team also won in 2008 but was later disqualified after one of Bolt's teammates, Nesta Carter, was sanctioned for doping.)
